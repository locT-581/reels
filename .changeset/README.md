# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code.

## How to use Changesets

### Adding a changeset

When you make changes that should result in a version bump, run:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This will prompt you to:
1. Select which packages have changed
2. Select the type of version bump (major, minor, patch)
3. Write a summary of the changes

### Versioning

When you're ready to release, run:

```bash
pnpm changeset version
```

This will:
- Consume all changesets
- Update package versions
- Generate/update CHANGELOG.md files

### Publishing

To publish to npm:

```bash
pnpm changeset publish
```

Or use the release script:

```bash
pnpm release
```

## Version Guidelines

- **patch**: Bug fixes, small improvements (0.0.x)
- **minor**: New features, backward-compatible (0.x.0)
- **major**: Breaking changes (x.0.0)

## Linked Packages

All @vortex/* packages are linked, meaning they will always have the same version number.
